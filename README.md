# Code Refactor Starter Code
Module 1 Challenge - UCI Bootcamp 05-12-22

Refactored client website(Horiseon) for ease of reading and editing in future applications. Fixed code with incorrect syntax, non-working links, added alternative titles to img tags, and consolidated redundant CSS declaration blocks. All alterations made with no change to overall feel and design of original website.
